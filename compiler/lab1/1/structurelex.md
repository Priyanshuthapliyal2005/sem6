1. Definition Section / Declaration
   %{
   // C code, header files, and global variables
   #include <stdio.h>
   int a, b, c;
   %}
   Purpose: This section is used to include C code, header files, and declare global variables that will be accessible throughout the lexer.
   #include <stdio.h>: This line includes the standard input-output library, which allows the use of functions like printf for outputting text to the console.
   Global Variables: The integers a, b, and c are declared here. These variables can be used in the actions associated with the patterns defined later in the lexer.
2. Rule Section
   %%
   pattern1 { // Action for pattern1 }
   pattern2 { // Action for pattern2 }
   . { // Default action (usually echoing characters) }
   %%
   Purpose: This section defines the patterns that the lexer will recognize and the actions to take when those patterns are matched.
   Patterns:
   pattern1: This is a placeholder for a specific pattern that the lexer will match. The action associated with this pattern will be executed when it is found in the input.
   pattern2: Similar to pattern1, this is another placeholder for a different pattern.
   .: This pattern matches any single character that does not match the previous patterns. The action associated with this pattern is typically a default action, such as echoing the character back to the output.
3. User Code Section / MAIN Section (Optional)
   int main() {
   yylex(); // Call the lexer
   return 0;
   }

int yywrap() {
return 1;
}
int main(): This is the main function of the program, which serves as the entry point.
yylex();: This function call invokes the lexer, which begins the process of reading input and matching patterns.
return 0;: This indicates that the program has completed successfully.
int yywrap(): This function is called by yylex() when it reaches the end of the input.
return 1;: Returning 1 indicates that there are no more input files to process, signaling the lexer to stop.
Summary
This lexer structure is a foundational setup for creating a lexical analyzer using the Lex tool. It includes sections for declarations, pattern matching, and the main execution flow. The patterns and actions defined in the rule section will determine how the lexer processes input and what actions it takes based on the recognized patterns.
